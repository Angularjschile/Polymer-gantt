Polymer-gantt
=============

This is gantt-chart Web Component. Written using [Polymer library](https://github.com/polymer/polymer).

Right now you can change the end and start time of event, move the events, scale the gantt chart and pan the timeline. 

This is at an very early stage, but I decided to publish it any way since it might be interesting for people to check out a real use of Polymer.

Working on right now:
- Dates and time on timeline
- Sub-events

More information will come soon...
